    Xml wIdget Template compiler:  
    
    Compiler uses very simplest way.

    If you have using in XSLT expressions xpath for retriveing WIDGET information
    begins from '/widget/'  (for example:  /widget/@attribute)
    then comiler switches to WIDGET mode and performs copying your
    template code into output template

    If you have using xpath for getting OBJECT information then compiler
    switches to GEN (generation) mode and performs generating instruction
    for creating your code in target template

    If you have using instructions without using address /widget/ or /object/
    then compiler performs transformations according to current mode.
    
    Compiler performs tesing only @test, @select and @name tags of XSLT instructions

    Run:
    xsltproc compiler.xsl <source.xsl> -o <result.xsl>
    or
    php compiler.php <source.xsl> <result.xsl>
